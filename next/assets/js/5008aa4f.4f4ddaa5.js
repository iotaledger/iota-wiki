The basic idea of the actor model is to have isolated actors, each taking care of some functionality. Actors receive messages with data to act upon and return data when they finish processing it.

Dead-locks will never occur. "),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"The actor system is almost ubiquitous in the target architecture.

STMs have been around for quite some time. In STMs, each operation on memory happens in an atomic transaction. Whenever memory is modified, this modification is written into a log. While inside a transaction, reading from memory also is done through a log. The transaction has finished when all changes recorded inside the log have been committed to the actual memory. A transaction fails if another thread tries to modify the targeted piece of memory between operations. A failed transaction can be re-run any number of times. "),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"This approach guarantees that modifications to memory are always consistent, but it comes with a restriction. Since transactions can be retried, operations inside a transaction must be idempotent and should not have any side effects. In an extreme case, think of a function that launches an ICMB: you can not reverse the process. Another edge case concerning STM-based approaches is interleaving transactions, where reads and writes are alternating between two threads. In a worst-case scenario, both transactions would retry indefinitely."))}u.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
