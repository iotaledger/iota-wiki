# Testnet and Test Tokens

## Connect to the Testnet API

We recommend you start interacting with Shimmer on a _testnet_ network. The _testnet_ will allow you to safely get
acquainted with the IOTA SDK without the risk of losing any funds if you make a mistake along the way.

You can use this public load-balanced Shimmer Testnet API:

```plaintext
https://api.testnet.shimmer.network
```

## Explore the Network

You can use the [Shimmer Tangle Explorer](https://explorer.shimmer.network/testnet) to view transactions and data stored
in the Tangle.

## Get Test Tokens

You will need some tokens to test value-based transactions on testnet network properly. You can get some testnet tokens
through the [Shimmer Faucet](https://faucet.testnet.shimmer.network).
