Once you have [created your account](../accounts-and-addresses/create-account.mdx),
you can start using the IOTA SDK for value transactions. Since these examples target the testnet, you can request funds
using the `request_funds_from_faucet` function.

## Code Example

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString>
<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

The following example will:

1. Instantiate a [`Wallet`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/core/struct.Wallet.html), Get Alice's `Account` which was
   [created in the first guide](../accounts-and-addresses/create-account.mdx) and [sync it](../accounts-and-addresses/check-balance.mdx).
2. Get all the [`AccountAddress`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/types/struct.AccountAddress.html)
   related to the `Account` by calling the [`Account.addresses()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.AccountInner.html#method.addresses)
   function.
3. Request funds to the `FAUCET_URL` you defined in the `.env` file by calling the [`Client::utils::request_funds_from_faucet`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/client/utils/fn.request_funds_from_faucet.html) function.

```rust reference

```

<TabItem value="typescript-node" label="Typescript (Node.js)">

The following example will:

1. Instantiate a [`Wallet`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/core/struct.Wallet.html), Get Alice's `Account` which was
   [created in the first guide](../accounts-and-addresses/create-account.mdx) and [sync it](../accounts-and-addresses/check-balance.mdx).
2. Retrieve the first address related to Alice's account by calling the
   [`Account.addresses()`](../../references/nodejs/classes/Account/#addresses) function.
3. Request funds to the `FAUCET_URL` you defined in the `.env` file by calling the [`Client.requestFundsFromFaucet`]
   (../../references/nodejs/classes/Client/#requestfundsfromfaucet) function.

```typescript reference

2. Get all the [`Addresses`](../../references/python/iota_sdk/types/address/)
   related to the `Account` by calling the [`Account.addresses()`](../../references/python/iota_sdk/wallet/account/#addresses)
