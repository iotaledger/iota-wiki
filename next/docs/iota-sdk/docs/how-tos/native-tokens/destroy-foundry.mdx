You can destroy a foundry by calling the `Account.burn(burn, options)` function. The function will
destroy a foundry output as long as its circulating
[native token](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/introduction/explanations/ledger/foundry) supply is zero. 

<DestroyFoundry/>

## Code Example

Before you run the example you should make sure the first foundy on your account has zero circulating supply. If you have no available
foundries, you can create one by [creating a native token](create.mdx). If you've already created your
tokens but need to empty the foundry, you can decrease your native token supply by [melting them](melt.mdx).

The following example will:

1. Create a wallet.
2. Get Alice's account which was [created in the first guide](../accounts-and-addresses/create-account.mdx).
3. [Get the account's balance](./../accounts-and-addresses/check-balance.mdx) and show the amount of foundries.
4. Try to destroy the first [foundry](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/introduction/explanations/ledger/foundry) output.
5. Get the account's foundry count again to show the difference after step 4.
