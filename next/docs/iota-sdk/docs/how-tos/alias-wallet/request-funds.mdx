Alias addresses play a significant role in decentralized systems, particularly in managing and identifying various assets.
Unlike traditional addresses associated with specific user accounts, Alias addresses are specifically assigned to Alias
and NFT outputs. These outputs have their own unique addresses, enabling them to hold their respective base tokens or
any other native assets. This means that you could transfer ownership of all the assets controlled by the Alias address
by transferring its Alias output.

<AliasNFT />
<TipFaucet />

## Code Example

The following example will:

1. Create a wallet.
2. Get Alice's account which was [created in the first guide](../accounts-and-addresses/create-account.mdx).
3. Retrieve the address of the first Alias output.
4. Request funds to the `FAUCET_URL` you defined in the `.env` file.
