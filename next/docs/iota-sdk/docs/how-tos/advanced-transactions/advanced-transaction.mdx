If you need more advanced features or unlock conditions in your transaction this guide will show you how to send custom outputs.
You can use the related How-To guides to learn more about crating custom outputs with specific [unlock conditions](../outputs/unlock-conditions.mdx)
and [features](../outputs/features.mdx).

## Code Example

<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

The following example will:

1. Instantiate a [`Wallet`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/core/struct.Wallet.html), get Alice's `Account` which was
   [created in the first guide](../accounts-and-addresses/create-account.mdx) and [sync it](../accounts-and-addresses/check-balance.mdx).
2. Create a [`BasicOutput`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/types/block/output/basic/struct.BasicOutput.html)
   that is [time-locked](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/develop/explanations/what-is-stardust/unlock-conditions/#timelock) for one
   hour by calling the [`BasicOutputBuilder()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/types/block/output/basic/struct.BasicOutputBuilder.html)
   function and passing the [`AddressUnlockCondition`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/types/block/output/unlock_condition/struct.AddressUnlockCondition.html) and
   the [`TimelockUnlockCondition`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/types/block/output/unlock_condition/struct.TimelockUnlockCondition.html) in as
   [`unlockConditions`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/types/block/output/unlock_condition/struct.UnlockConditions.html)
   to the `BasicOutputBuilder()` by chaining calls to the
   [`BasicOutputBuilder.add_unlock_condition()`](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/types/block/output/basic/struct.BasicOutputBuilder.html#method.add_unlock_condition)
3. Send the `BasicOutput` created in the previous step by calling the
   ['Account.send_outputs()'](https://docs.rs/iota-sdk/latest/iota_sdk/wallet/account/struct.Account.html#method.send_outputs) function.
4. Await for the `Transaction` to get confirmed by calling the ['Account.retryTransactionUntilIncluded'](../../references/nodejs/classes/Account/#retrytransactionuntilincluded)
   function.
