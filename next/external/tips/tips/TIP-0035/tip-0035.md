# Summary

This TIP defines a file format for local snapshots which is compatible with Stardust.
The version of the snapshot file format described in this TIP is `Version 2`.

# Motivation

Nodes create local snapshots to produce ledger representations at a point in time of a given milestone to be able to:

* Start up from a recent milestone instead of having to synchronize from the genesis transaction.
* Delete old transaction data below a given milestone.

For Stardust, this file format has to be assimilated to support protocol parameters and to contain the milestone
at the point of the snapshot index in order extract startup metadata from it.

# Detailed design

Since a UTXO based ledger is much larger in size, this TIP proposes two formats for snapshot files:

* A `full` format which represents a complete ledger state.
* A `delta` format which only contains diffs (created and consumed outputs) of milestones from a given milestone index
  onwards.

This separation allows nodes to swiftly create new delta snapshot files, which then can be distributed with a companion
full snapshot file to reconstruct a recent state.

### Formats

> All types are serialized in little-endian

#### Full Ledger State

A full ledger snapshot file contains the UTXOs (`outputs` section) of a node's confirmed
milestone (`Ledger Milestone Index`). The `diffs` contain the diffs to rollback the `outputs` state to regain the ledger
state of the snapshot `Target Milestone Index`.

While the node producing such a full ledger state snapshot could theoretically pre-compute the actual snapshot milestone
state, this is deferred to the consumer of the data to speed up local snapshot creation.

#### Delta Ledger State

A delta ledger state local snapshot only contains the `diffs` of milestones starting from a
given `Full Snapshot Target Milestone Index`. A node consuming such data must know the state of the ledger at `Full Snapshot Target Milestone Index`.

# Updating an existing Delta snapshot file

When creating a delta snapshot, an existing delta snapshot file can be reused.

In order to do that, the following steps need to be done:
1. Open the existing delta snapshot file.
2. Read the existing delta snapshot file header.
3. Verify that `Version` and `Full Snapshot Target Milestone ID` match between the existing and new delta snapshot.
4. Seek to the position of `Target Milestone Index` and replace it with the new value.
5. Seek to the position of `Target Milestone Timestamp` and replace it with the new value.
6. Seek to the position that is written in the existing `SEP File Offset` and truncate the file at this position.
7. Add the additional `Milestone Diffs` at this position.
8.  Add the new `SEPs`.
9.  Seek to the position of `SEP File Offset` and replace it with the new value.
10. Seek to the position of `Milestone Diffs Count` and replace it with the new value.
11. Seek to the position of `SEPs Count` and replace it with the new value.
12. Close the file.

# Drawbacks

Nodes need to support this new format.

# Rationale and alternatives

* In conjunction with a companion full snapshot, a tool or node can "truncate" the data from a delta snapshot back to a
  single full snapshot. In that case, the `Ledger Milestone Index` and `Target Milestone Index` would be the same. In the
  example above, given the full and delta snapshots, one could produce a new full snapshot for milestone 1350.
* Since snapshots may include millions of UTXOs, code generating such files needs to stream data directly onto disk
  instead of keeping the entire representation in memory. In order to facilitate this, the count denotations for SEPs,
  UTXOs and diffs are at the beginning of the file. This allows code generating snapshot files to only have to seek back
  once after the actual count of elements is known.
