      summary: Returns the health of the node.
      description: >-
        Returns the health of the node. A node considers itself healthy if its solid
        milestone is at most two delta away from the latest known milestone, has at
        least one ongoing gossip stream and the latest known milestone is newer
        than 5 minutes. This information might be useful for load-balancing
        or uptime monitoring.

        missing: `parents`, `nonce`.

A block can be considered as a valid milestone block if the milestone payload is valid and if the referenced parents in the milestone payload do match the referenced parents in the block itself. Note it's possible to have different milestone blocks that all represent the same milestone.
        ledgerInclusionState:
          type: string

          description: If `included`, the block contains a transaction that has been included in the ledger. If `conflicitng`, the block contains a transaction that has not been included in the ledger because it conflicts with another transaction. If the block does not contain a transaction, `ledgerInclusionState` is set to `noTransaction`.

            Values:
              * `1` - denotes that the referenced UTXO was already spent.
              * `2` - denotes that the referenced UTXO was already spent while confirming this milestone.
              * `3` - denotes that the referenced UTXO cannot be found.
              * `4` - denotes that the sum of the inputs and output values does not match.

              * `8` - denotes that the return amount in a transaction is not fulfilled by the output side.
              * `9` - denotes that the input unlock is invalid.
              * `10` - denotes that the inputs commitment is invalid.
              * `11` - denotes that an output contains a Sender with an ident (address) which is not unlocked.
              * `12` - denotes that the chain state transition is invalid.
              * `255` - denotes that the semantic validation failed.
