# Alias Transactions

Stardust introduces a new output type called
[_Alias Output_](https://github.com/lzpap/tips/blob/master/tips/TIP-0018/tip-0018.md#alias-output) that is essentially a
UTXO state machine. Simply put, this represents a new type of ledger account suitable for committee ran smart contract
chains.

The main features are:

- Storage of state commitments of the second-layer smart contract chains.
- Globally unique address assigned upon creation.
- Different account privileges for two controllers that can be rotated.
- The ability of issuing custom tokens that are linked to the unique address.

Alias outputs can be created by anyone in the protocol via transactions. A newly created alias receives a unique
identifier, or _Alias ID_, generated by the protocol based on the content of the transaction that created it. Once an
alias output is created, only its controllers can unlock it in subsequent transactions. Depending on which controller
unlocks it, different commands or state mutations are possible.

## State Controller

 The _State Controller_ is allowed to change the state data stored in the output and also to manipulate token balances
 of the alias account. If the _State Controller_ unlocks the alias output in a transaction, it must
 [transition the alias into its new state](state-transitions.mdx), meaning the alias output must appear in the
 transaction as a created output.

## Governor

The _Governor_ on the other hand may choose to [destroy the alias](destroy.mdx) by not creating its subsequent state as
an output in the transaction. It also has the power to change the controller entities.

## Unlock Alias Funds

Funds can be sent directly to the unique alias address (derived from _Alias ID_) of the alias by anyone. Since this
address is generated by the protocol, it doesn't have a private key that could be used for signing transactions to prove
ownership. So how does one prove that they own the funds locked under an alias address?

The trick is to require the unlocking of the alias output that defines the address in the same transaction that tries
to unlock funds sitting on the alias address. _If you can prove you own the alias account by successfully unlocking its
alias output in a transaction, you can access the funds locked under its address._
