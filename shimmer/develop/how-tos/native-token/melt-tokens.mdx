# Melt Tokens

Melting tokens removes them from the circulating supply. Melting can only be carried out if the foundry is included in
the transaction.

## Example Transaction

Transaction C assumes that the token issuer is in control of _mintAddress_ where the to-be melted tokens are locked.
This transaction will melt 250 of the foundry's tokens:

- _Melted Tokens_ of _Foundry Output #3_ is increased by the amount of melted tokens, 250.
- _Basic Output #3_ now has 250 tokens remaining. The input side of the transaction contains 500 tokens, but the output
  side only 250. By increasing _Melted Tokens_ on _Foundry Output #3_ the transaction becomes balanced.
- Looking at _Foundry Output #3_ you can determine that the circulating supply of the token is _Minted Tokens_ - _Melted Tokens_ = 750.
- In a subsequent transaction you could mint 250 tokens to reach _Maximum Supply_ again.
