# Claim a Conditional NFT Transfer

## Example Transaction

Transaction D shows how a _recipient_ can claim the conditional transfer initiated in
[Transaction C](transfer.mdx):

- The _recipient_ has to fund the transaction with the to-be refunded storage deposit, therefore _Basic Output #2_ is
  unlocked on the input side.
- _NFT Output #4_ removes the additional unlocks from the NFT and places it solely into the ownership of _recipient_.
- _Basic Output #3_ refunds the _owner_ with the storage deposit defined in the _Storage Deposit Return Unlock Condition_
  of _NFT Output #3_.
- Transaction D is only valid if the confirming milestone has a timestamp earlier than the one defined in the
  _Expiration Unlock Condition_ of _NFT Output #3_.
- Since both _NFT Output #3_ and _Basic Output #2_ are unlocked by _recipient_ address, it is enough to sign the transaction
  once in _Signature Unlock #1_ and reference this unlock in _Reference Unlock #2_.
