# NFT as a Wallet

Each NFT has its own unique _NFT ID_ that also functions as an address on protocol level. The address can be deterministically
generated from the ID as outlined in [TIP-31](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/blob/main/tips/TIP-0031/tip-0031.md), basically
prepending _NFT ID_ with the _NFT Address Type_ and encoding it as a [Bech32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki) string.

This means that any output (except for a foundry) can be locked to an _NFT Address_ in the protocol. An _NFT Address_
is a first class citizen on protocol level, just like an _Ed25519 Address_.

To unlock outputs locked under an _NFT Address_, the owner of the NFT must also unlock the _NFT Output_ that defines it,
hence proving ownership of the address. Note, that this is a significant difference compared to _Ed25519 Addresses_, where
ownership is proved via a signing the transaction with a private key

## Example Transactions

### Unlock Funds Owned by the NFT

Transaction F shows how one can unlock an output locked to an _NFT Address_. Notice, that _Basic Output #4_ contains
not only base tokens, but also native tokens. An _NFT Output_ supports holding these native token directly in the output itself,
but it would also be possible to place them in any output after _Basic Output #4_ is unlocked. It is the decision of the
owner of the NFT to define what outputs to create in the transaction.

Just like any other output, an _NFT Output_ supports holding up to _Max Native Token Count_ (defined in
[TIP-22](https://github.com/Wollac/protocol-rfcs/blob/protocol-parameters/tips/TIP-0022/tip-0022.md#detailed-design)
for IOTA and [TIP-32](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/blob/shimmer-params/tips/TIP-0032/tip-0032.md#global-parameters)
for Shimmer). In case you need to store more native tokens, distribute them in _Basic Outputs_ that are owned by the NFT.

### Transfer an NFT owned by the NFT

So far in the examples the NFTs were always owned by a private key backed address, therefore they were unlocked via
a signature. What happens when an NFT is owned by another NFT?

Similarly to Transaction F, the NFT that owns the other one must be unlocked in the transaction to prove the ownership.
Transaction G shows how the "owner NFT" can unlock the "owned NFT" and transfer it to a new recipient.

:::warning Circular Ownership
It is possible to introduce circular ownership with _NFT Addresses_ (and also with _Alias Addresses_). In such a case,
NFT A is owned by NFT B, while NFT B is owned by NFT A. This would mean that unlocking them in a transaction doesn't
require a signature, therefore anyone could unlock them that leads to race conditions on protocol level.

To prevent this undesired property, the protocol forces an _NFT Unlock_ to only be able to reference a previous _Unlock_. As a result,
circular ownership becomes a deadlock, as neither NFTs can be unlocked anymore.

Wallets and applications should implement mitigation strategies to prevent a deadlock: always perform circular ownership
checks before sending an NFT to another NFT!
