# Tag

The _Tag Feature_ allows you to associate a maximum 64 bytes long indexation tag with an output. Similarly to
the [_Metadata Feature_](metadata.mdx), the actual _Tag_ is treated as binary data by the protocol.

Note that, by default, nodes do not store and expose the indexation by tag. However, the
[Indexer API](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/blob/indexer-api/tips/TIP-0026/tip-0026.md) does. In an "IOTA as a
payment method" use case the _Tag_ field could be used as a payment reference field, much like the payment reference
option of a regular wire transfer.
