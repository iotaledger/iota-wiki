# Sender

Stardust allows you to define optional _Features_ on outputs of a transfer that do not impact the actual unlocking of
the created output.  The _Sender_ feature lets the creator of the output define an explicit _Sender Address_ attribute
for the output.

The _Sender_ attribute is validated on protocol level. Validation ensures that the transaction that created the output
unlocked the _Sender_ address on the input side. Therefore, this feature is a protocol validated proof that the output
was created by someone who controls the _Sender_ address.

## Example Transaction

Transaction J shows how you can add a sender attribute to a created output. Note, that Transaction J would be invalid
if:
 - _Basic Output #15_ wouldn't be locked to _senderAddress_, or
 - _Basic Output #16_ would define _Sender_ as anything else than the _senderAddress_ from _Basic Output #15_.

On-ledger requests (originating from L1) of IOTA Smart Contracts use this feature heavily, but it is also possible to
fetch outputs created by a specific party with the _Sender Feature_ through the
[INX UTXO indexer application](https://github.com/gohornet/inx-indexer) and
[REST API](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/blob/indexer-api/tips/TIP-0026/tip-0026.md).
