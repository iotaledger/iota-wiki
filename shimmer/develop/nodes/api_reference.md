# Introduction

You can find specifications for the Core REST API for the IOTA node software in the [next](../core-rest-api/iota-rest-api) section.

The node event API is in charge of publishing information about events within the node software. You can find more information in the [Node event API reference](https://studio.asyncapi.com/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iotaledger/tips/main/tips/TIP-0028/event-api.yml).
