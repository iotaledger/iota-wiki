# Abstract

The payload concept offers a very flexible way to combine and encapsulate information in the IOTA protocol. This document proposes a basic payload type that allows the addition of arbitrary data.

# Motivation

The most flexible way to extend an existing object is by the addition of arbitrary data. This payload provides a way to do just that. An optional tag can be used to categorize the data.

# Specification

## Serialized Layout

The following table describes the serialization of a _Tagged Data Payload_ following the notation from [TIP-21](../TIP-0021/tip-0021.md):

| Name         | Type              | Description                                              |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Payload Type | uint32            | Set to *value 5* to denote an _Tagged Data Payload_.     |
| Tag          | (uint8)ByteArray  | The tag of the data. A leading uint8 denotes its length. |
| Data         | (uint32)ByteArray | Binary data. A leading uint32 denotes its length.        |

It is important to note that `Tag` is not considered by the protocol, it just serves as a marker for second layer applications.

## Syntactic Validation

- `length(Tag)` must not be larger than [`Max Tag Length`](../TIP-0022/tip-0022.md).
- Given the type and length information, the _Tagged Data Payload_ must consume the entire byte array of the `Payload` field of the encapsulating object.

# Rationale

As the tag is not considered by the protocol, it could also be removed completely. However, Legacy IOTA and Chrysalis supported sending of arbitrary data indexed with a tag. Thus, in order to simplify the migration of second layer applications using these protocols, the optional `Tag` has been added which can be used in a similar manner.
