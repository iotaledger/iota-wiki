# Welcome

This is documentation section about IOTA documentation: what we write and how we write. This section covers everything you need to know to start contributing to the wiki, in the [How To](../how_tos/developer.md) section you can find practical advice to improve your writing, and we keep all our guidelines under Reference. Our [manifesto](../reference/style/manifesto.md) contains the gist of it.

If you want to elaborate on a topic or fix a typo, there are buttons at the bottom of every article. You can edit a page with the built-in WYSIWYG editor, or plain Markdown editor on GitHub. This will submit your changes to the wiki's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/iota-community/iota-wiki) where the community would review and approve them. You can also submit a PR manually. In any case, you would need a GitHub account.

## Chat with Us

IOTA Wiki maintainers hang out in the `#iota-wiki` channel of the [IOTA Discord server](../../the-community/discord.md). You can always leave your feedback there or talk with a programmer, an artist, or a technical writer about your contribution.
