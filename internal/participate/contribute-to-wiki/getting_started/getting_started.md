# Getting Started

If you want to edit a document to elaborate on a topic or fix a typo, you need to edit its source file. General topics and most of the user-oriented content is stored directly in the [IOTA Wiki's repository] (https://github.com/iota-community/iota-wiki), but most of its content comes from repositories of projects within IOTA ecosystem:

* [Bee](https://github.com/iotaledger/bee.git)
* [Blueprints](https://github.com/iotaledger/blueprints)
* [Chronicle](https://github.com/iotaledger/chronicle.rs)
* [Chrysalis Documentation](https://github.com/iotaledger/chrysalis-docs)
* [Client](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs)
* [GoShimmer](https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer)
* [Hornet](https://github.com/gohornet/hornet)
* [Identity](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs)
* [Integration Service](https://github.com/iotaledger/integration-services)
* [Smart Contracts](https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp)
* [Stronghold](https://github.com/iotaledger/stronghold.rs)
* [Wallet](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs)
* [Zebra Tutorials](https://github.com/ZebraDevs/Zebra-Iota-Edge-SDK)

Once you find the source file, you can edit it directly in GitHub by clicking the pencil-icon button on the top right of it:

It will open an editor with a user-friendly interface which will help you to submit your changes for a review. To learn more about git and GitHub, you can check the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com).
