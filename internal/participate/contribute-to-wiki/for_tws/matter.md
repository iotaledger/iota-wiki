## Facts and Opinions

The IOTA wiki is maintained by IOTA enthusiasts and employees, which makes it prone to a natural bias. Keep it neutral in tone, never inject your or others' opinion, and stick to facts that the reader could verify.

You could have strong feelings towards the subject of your article — and one could argue that you must have them to create truly radiant writing. Consider this: there cannot be a real opinion until you understand the topic, and the chances are that the reader will come to the same conclusions as you did after seeing a neutral and thorough research.

## Current State

Only describe the current state of the subject, not what the development team would like to change one day. The line is thin: for example, it would benefit everyone if you invite the reader to an existing discussion about an upcoming change.
