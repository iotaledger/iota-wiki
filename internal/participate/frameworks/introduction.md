# IOTA Frameworks

The IOTA foundation maintains and develops a collection of frameworks building on the Tangle.

## List of Frameworks

[![Layer2-frameworks](/img/learn/layer2-frameworks.png)](/img/learn/layer2-frameworks.png)

- [Streams](/internal/participate/frameworks/streams):  
  Streams is an organizational tool for structuring and navigating secure data through the Tangle. Streams organizes data by ordering it in a uniform and interoperable structure.
- [Identity](/internal/participate/frameworks/identity):  
  The IOTA Identity framework implements the most common standards and patterns for Decentralized Identity in both a DLT agnostic and iota method specification manner.
- [Smart Contracts](/internal/participate/frameworks/smart-contracts):  
  The IOTA Smart Contract Protocol (ISCP) is the implementation of Smart Contracts on IOTA.
- [Access](/internal/participate/frameworks/access):  
  IOTA Access is an open-source framework used to build access control systems for smart devices. It is designed to work with any IoT resource, whether it's a vehicle, smart lock, or embedded sensor.
- [Stronghold](/internal/participate/frameworks/stronghold):  
  A library for secure secret handling and storage.
- [Oracles](/internal/participate/frameworks/oracles):  
  IOTA Oracles bring off-chain data to decentralized applications and smart contracts on the IOTA network.
