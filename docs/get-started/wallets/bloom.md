Bloom is a desktop wallet with first-class security developed by former members of the Firefly team.
Bloom supports the [IOTA](https://wiki.iota.org/build/networks-endpoints/#iota-mainnet) and
[Shimmer](https://wiki.iota.org/build/networks-endpoints/#shimmer) networks, as well as
[ShimmerEVM](https://wiki.iota.org/build/networks-endpoints/#shimmerevm) in the same application. This means you can
seamlessly transfer assets back and forth between Shimmer and ShimmerEVM without other tooling.

## Security

The Bloom wallet underwent a thorough security audit by [Auditone](https://www.auditone.io/), ensuring its reliability and safety.


## Streamlined Identity Verification

Bloom incorporates an identification solution that features a single, reusable KYC event to identify its users across
multiple Web3 services, which was developed in collaboration with the IOTA Foundation, [IDNow](https://www.idnow.io/),
[walt.id](https://walt.id/) and [Spyce5](https://spyce5.com/).

## Interoperability

Bloom is compatible with Ledger Nano hardware wallets and also enables token, NFT, and data transfers between Layer 1 and
Layer 2 chains without bridges, showcasing IOTA's powerful cross-chain architecture.

### Future Updates

Bloom aims to broaden its appeal even further by expanding its services to encompass Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon, and
other important EVM L1s and L2s, alongside introducing features like social login for simple sign-up with Web2 OAuth
credentials like Gmail or iCloud, cementing its position as a versatile wallet for the wider Web3 community.

The Bloom Wallet is available on Mac, Windows, and Linux.
