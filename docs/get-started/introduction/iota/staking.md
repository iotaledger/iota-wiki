# Staking IOTA

:::info

There are several ways to stake your tokens and earn staking rewards:

- Shimmer and Assembly pre-launch staking: Stake IOTA tokens to receive the native tokens of Shimmer (SMR) and
  Assembly (ASMB) networks.
- Assembly post-launch staking: Continue staking IOTA tokens to receive ASMB tokens in the newly launched Assembly
  network.
- ASMB token staking: Stake ASMB tokens to secure the Assembly network and receive rewards.

## IOTA Staking for SMR Rewards

:::info SMR Rewards Ended
The staking periods for SMR have ended, you can no longer stake IOTA to receive SMR.
:::

The Shimmer network, a staging network for IOTA's core technology innovations, can be bootstrapped solely from IOTA
token stakers.

- The rate for SMR distribution is set at `1 SMR per 1 MIOTA per milestone`.
- Rewards are distributed to IOTA stakers based on their stake.
- The Firefly wallet holds the record of rewards for IOTA token holders.

## IOTA Staking for ASMB Rewards

During multiple 90-day staking rounds, IOTA token holders can stake their tokens in the Firefly wallet to receive ASMB
tokens.

- The rate for ASMB distribution is set at `0.000004 ASMB tokens per 1 MIOTA per milestone`.
- For every 1 MIOTA staked, 0.000004 ASMB tokens will be rewarded every 10 seconds.
- The Firefly wallet holds the record of rewards for IOTA token holders.

## Assembly Post-launch Staking

After the launch of the Assembly network, IOTA token holders can continue staking their tokens to receive ASMB tokens
for 21 months.

- A total of 20% of the Assembly supply is allocated to IOTA token stakers.
- ASMB tokens will be distributed based on the number of tokens staked.
- Daily fixed rate distributions will occur over the 21-month staking period.

## ASMB Token Staking

Assembly offers two mechanisms for rewarding ASMB token stakers:

1. Inflationary token distribution: ASMB holders receive newly minted ASMB tokens.

   - The yearly inflation rate for the Assembly supply is 8%.
   - The specific mechanism for distribution is yet to be published.

2. Staking for security: ASMB token holders can stake their tokens with a validator to secure the Assembly smart
   contract chains.
   - Validators are required to deposit ASMB tokens as a security bond.
   - Validators may use tokens deposited by ASMB holders.
   - Delegated stake increases the security bond and allows validators to offer higher rewards to stakers.

By participating in staking, IOTA token holders can earn rewards and contribute to the security and functionality of the
IOTA network ecosystem.
