# IOTA Token

The IOTA token is the medium to transfer value within the IOTA mainnet. However, unlike other cryptos
there are no fees to be paid with the base token, meaning that IOTA tokens are transferred 1 to 1 to the receiver,
without miners or other intermediaries taking a cut.

## Fair Distribution & No Inflation

Unlike most other cryptocurrencies, all 2,779,530,283,277,76 IOTA tokens have been fairly distributed upon its
initial ICO without any early VC funding or tokens allocated to founders. Furthermore, there are no vesting schedules
or token lockups, meaning the entire supply is circulating.

IOTA has no inflation baked into its protocol, meaning that token holders are not getting
artificially diluted and the supply stays static.
