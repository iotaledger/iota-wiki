# Explanations

You should use the Explanations folder to give in-depth [explanations](https://diataxis.fr/explanation/) on any topic that's relevant to your project.

## Single Responsibility Principle

Similar to the SOLID principles, you should try to adhere to the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle) when writing
explanations. Each article should address a single topic, and any sub-topics if relevant. If you need to touch on a different subject while doing so, you should add a link to that subjects explanation, rather than fully explain it.

The main topic should be the first header in the article, and any subtopics (or even a subtopic's subtopic) should follow hierarchically by using the appropriate header tag level.

## Related How Tos And Tutorials

Your explanation articles will probably relate to one or more [How Tos](how_tos.md) or [tutorials](tutorials.md). Please make sure to list them in the article, so the user can have a hands-on experience while learning the concepts, or visit them afterwards.
