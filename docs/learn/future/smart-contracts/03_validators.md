## 🏗 Work in Progress

In this article you will learn how the IOTA Smart Contract validators works.

A validator is someone who runns an IOTA Smart Contracts Node, called Wasp. You can learn how to setup a Wasp node [here in the Build section](/).

“Off-chain” smart contracts, like in IOTA Smart Contracts, are executed outside of the core protocol. Only a subset of nodes, called a commwittee, need to execute them and a consensus can be reached outside of the core protocol.

Each IOTA Smart Contract chain is run under the consensus of its validators, so each chain is a distributed system, the system without a single point of failure.

How they form a group, management and rotation
