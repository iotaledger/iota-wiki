While IOTA Identity implements many existing standards, it also adds some additional features we would like to standardize ourselves. This section covers these features and how they work in great detail. These are not light reads and can be skipped.

The current specifications are:

- [IOTA DID](iota-did-method-spec.mdx): The specification for the IOTA DID Method implemented on the _Tangle_.
- [Revocation Bitmap 2022](revocation-bitmap-2022.mdx): The specification for an on-Tangle credential revocation mechanism.
