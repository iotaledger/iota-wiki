# Revoke a Verifiable Credential

The [example](#example) below demonstrates two methods that an issuer can use to revoke a verifiable credential
using the IOTA Identity Framework:

1. By using the [`credentialStatus`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#status) field in a credential and linking to a
[revocation bitmap](#revocation-bitmap),
using the [`RevocationBitmap2022`](/identity.rs/references/specifications/revocation-bitmap-2022/).
2. By [removing the verification method](#removing-the-verification-method) that signed the credential.
This invalidates all credentials that were signed with that verification method.

## Revocation Bitmap


One of the ways for an issuer to control the status of its credentials is by using a revocation list.
At the most basic level, revocation information for all verifiable credentials issued by an issuer are expressed as
simple binary values.
The issuer keeps a list of all verifiable credentials it has issued in a bitmap.
Each verifiable credential is associated with a unique index in the list.

```

If the binary value of the index in the bitmap is 1 (one), the verifiable credential is revoked,
if it is 0 (zero) it is not revoked.

For example, with this approach the issuer adds an index to a credential in the `credentialStatus` field, such as `"5"`.
This part of the credential might then look like this:

```json
"credentialStatus": {
  "id": "did:iota:EvaQhPXXsJsGgxSXGhZGMCvTt63KuAFtaGThx6a5nSpw#revocation",
  "type": "RevocationBitmap2022",
  "revocationBitmapIndex": "5"
},
```

The verifier uses the `id` field (`did:iota:EvaQhPXXsJsGgxSXGhZGMCvTt63KuAFtaGThx6a5nSpw#revocation`) to look up the
service in the issuer's DID document:

```json
{
  "id": "did:iota:EvaQhPXXsJsGgxSXGhZGMCvTt63KuAFtaGThx6a5nSpw#revocation",
  "type": "RevocationBitmap2022",
  "serviceEndpoint": "data:application/octet-stream;base64,ZUp5ek1tQmdZR1NBQUFFZ1ptVUFBQWZPQUlF"
}
```

During verification, the verifier decodes the revocation bitmap embedded in the `data` url.
This bitmap written as a bitstring looks like this: `000001`.
Here, the 5th bit is set, which means the credential with that index is revoked,
while all other credentials aren't revoked.

## Removing the Verification Method

A less efficient alternative is to remove the verification method that signed the credential from the DID Document of
the issuer.
This means the VC can no longer be validated.

However, this will also invalidate every VC signed with that verification method,
meaning that the issuer will have to sign every VC with a different key to retain
precise control over which credential is revoked.
