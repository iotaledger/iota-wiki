# Verifiable Presentations

A verifiable presentation is the recommended data format for sharing one or more [verifiable credentials](./verifiable-credentials.mdx).
It is constructed and signed by a holder to prove control over their credentials and can be presented to a verifier for [validation](#validation).

For instance: after an issuer [creates and issues](./../how-tos/verifiable-credentials/create.mdx) a [verifiable credential](./verifiable-credentials.mdx) to a holder, such as a university issuing a degree to a graduate,
the holder stores it securely until asked to present it.
A company could then request proof of that university degree: the holder can [create a verifiable presentation](./../how-tos/verifiable-credentials/create.mdx)
containing their credential, which is already signed by their university, and present it to the company to [validate](./../how-tos/verifiable-credentials/create.mdx#validate-a-vc).

Note that verifiable presentations that contain personal data should, as with verifiable credentials, be transmitted and stored securely off-chain to satisfy data privacy regulations such as [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/).

## Security Considerations

### Replay Attacks

A verifiable presentation without a challenge and domain properties could potentially be stored by a malicious actor
and replayed to a different verifier, impersonating the holder.
This is because the holder's signature on a presentation would still be seen as valid indefinitely,
until they [rotate](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#verification-method-rotation) the verification method used.

To mitigate this, verifiers should always send a unique challenge and domain when requesting a verifiable presentation.
These properties are then included in the proof section of the presentation by the holder during signing using [Proof Options](#proof-options).
The digital signature prevents these properties from being altered as it would invalidate the signature, effectively preventing a malicious
actor from injecting different values into old verifiable presentations. A presentation without a challenge and domain
in its proof that matches what was sent by the verifier should be considered invalid.

The challenge string should be sufficiently random and unique for each verifiable presentation requested by a verifier to avoid
being predicted. The domain, which does not need to be random, is an additional measure. In the unlikely occurrence
of two verifiers generating the same random challenge, the domain would sufficiently distinguish those requests.

Holders may additionally specify that their signature on a verifiable presentation expires after a short duration, as
per [Proof Options](./../how-tos/verifiable-presentations/create-and-validate.mdx#proof-options). However, verifiers and different implementations could choose to ignore that property,
so setting a signature expiration alone should not be relied upon.
