# Welcome

Stardust protocol is the successor to IOTA 1.5, also known as _Chrysalis_, that transforms IOTA into a multi-asset ledger and enables the operation of [IOTA Smart Contracts](/learn/smart-contracts/introduction/). This page outlines the new concepts
and differences compared to Chrysalis, furthermore gives an overview of different components of the IOTA technology stack.

Stardust debuts on [Shimmer](https://shimmer.network/), the new staging network for IOTA, before being fully supported on the IOTA Mainnet.

This is the technical documentation for developers. For updates and network status, please visit [https://status.iota.org/](https://status.iota.org/).
