# Getting Started with Node.js

<WarningPasswordStorage />

## Requirements

- One of the following Node.js versions: '16.x', '18.x';

## Install the IOTA SDK

### Install Using a Package Manager

To start using the IOTA SDK in your Node.js project, you can install the IOTA SDK from your package manager of choice:

```bash npm2yarn
npm i @iota/sdk
```

### Build the Binding from Source

#### Requirements

If you want to build the IOTA SDK from source, please ensure you have the installed the following:

- A [supported version of Node and Rust](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon#platform-support).
- Python < 3.11
- Yarn v1

#### Windows

On Windows, you will also need LLVM. Our workflow uses
`https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/download/llvmorg-11.0.1/LLVM-11.0.1-win64.exe`. You may also need to set
an environment variable `RUSTFLAGS` to `-C target-feature=+crt-static`.

:::tip Install LLVM with Chocolatey

If you use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) you can install LLVM by executing `choco install llvm`

:::

#### Build

You can build the IOTA SDK from source by doing the following:

1. Download the repository to any directory you choose:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk
```

2. Move to the Node.js binding directory:

```shell
cd iota-sdk/bindings/nodejs
```

3. Install the necessary dependencies with either of the following commands:

<Tabs groupId="nodePackageManager" queryString>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```sh
npm install
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```shell
yarn install
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

4. Build the SDK:

<Tabs groupId="nodePackageManager" queryString>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```shell
npm run build
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```shell
yarn build
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This command uses the [cargo-cp-artifact](https://github.com/neon-bindings/cargo-cp-artifact) utility to run the Rust
build and copy the built library into `./build/Release/index.node`.
Prebuild requires that the binary is in `build/Release` as though it was built with node-gyp.

## Usage

### Client

After you [installed the library](#install-the-iota-sdk), you can create a `Client` instance and interface with it.

```typescript reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/blob/develop/bindings/nodejs/examples/client/getting-started.ts#L4-L23
```

### Wallet

After you [installed the library](#installing-the-iota-sdk), you can create a `Wallet` instance and interact with it.

```typescript reference
https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/blob/develop/bindings/nodejs/examples/wallet/getting-started.ts#L4-L60
```

## What's next?

### How-To Guides

Once you have [installed the IOTA SDK](#install-the-iota-sdk), you can start building your application. You can find
usage examples in this Wiki's [how-to guides](../how-tos/introduction.md).

### More Examples

You can use the provided code [examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-sdk/tree/develop/bindings/nodejs/examples)
to get acquainted with the IOTA SDK. You can use the following commands to run any example:

```bash
cd examples
yarn
yarn run-example ./[example folder]/[example file]
```

- Where `[example file]` is the file name from the example folder. For example:

```bash
yarn run-example  examples/client/00_get_info.ts
```
