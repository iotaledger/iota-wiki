# Testnet and Test Tokens

## Connect to the Public Testnet

We recommend you start interacting via the Public Testnet network. The Public Testnet will allow you to safely get
acquainted with the IOTA SDK without the risk of losing any funds if you make a mistake along the way.

You can use this public load-balanced Public Testnet API:

```plaintext
https://api.testnet.shimmer.network
```

## Explore the Network

You can use the [Public Testnet Explorer](https://explorer.shimmer.network/testnet) to view transactions and data stored
in the Tangle.

## Get Test Tokens

You can get Testnet token using the [Public Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.testnet.shimmer.network).
You only need to input a valid Testnet [address](accounts-and-addresses.md) and the faucet will send you test tokens,
so you can safely develop your application without risking any capital.
