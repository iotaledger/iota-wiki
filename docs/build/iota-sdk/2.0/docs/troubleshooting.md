# Troubleshooting

When you encounter a problem or need assistance while working with IOTA, there are several resources available to you.

## IOTA StackExchange

The [IOTA StackExchange](https://iota.stackexchange.com/) is a valuable tool for developers. There you can find many existing solutions and insights from the IOTA community.

## Discord Community

If you cannot find an immediate solution to your question, you may find help in the dedicated IOTA-SDK channel
within the official [IOTA Discord server](https://discord.iota.org). There you can engage with fellow developers and experts who can provide guidance and assistance.

## Joining the Discussion

If you wish to participate in broader discussions about the IOTA SDK or seek additional support, you can visit the
`#development` channel on the [IOTA Discord server](https://discord.iota.org). This channel serves as a hub for
discussions related to the IOTA client libraries, where you may interact with other developers and receive further
assistance.
