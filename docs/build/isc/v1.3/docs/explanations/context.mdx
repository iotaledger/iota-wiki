# Call Context

Understanding the call context is vital in leveraging the Wasm code within a sandboxed host environment effectively. The following section explains the distinction between different function calls and the role of WasmLib in setting up a smart contract.

## Function Calls: Func and View

Smart contract function calls come in two types, each having specific access levels to the smart contract state:

### Funcs

Func functions grants full mutable access, resulting in a state update. They accommodate both on-ledger and off-ledger requests, finalized once the state update is registered in the Tangle ledger.

### Views

View functions allow limited immutable access, **no state update occurs**. Views are ideal for quickly querying the contract's current state, they only facilitate off-ledger calls.

## Using Func and View

WasmLib offers distinct contexts for these function types, namely `ScFuncContext` for Func and `ScViewContext` for View, controlling the accessible functionality and enforcing usage constraints through compile-time type-checking.

## Smart Contract Setup with WasmLib

Setting up a smart contract requires the following:

### Defining Funcs and Views

Outline available Funcs and Views and communicate them to the host through WasmLib.
It ensures the correct dispatch of function calls and maintains necessary restrictions.

### Parameter and Return Value Determination

Establish the parameters and return values for each function. ISC uses simple dictionaries to store details, necessitating consistent (de)serialization handled adeptly by WasmLib.

### Utilizing Schema Tool

Although you can use the WasmLib directly, the Schema Tool is recommended for automatically generating and updating the smart contract framework in a type-safe manner, using the preferred language.

Grasping these concepts will facilitate a secure and efficient smart contract setup, steering clear of potential pitfalls while making the most of what WasmLib offers.
