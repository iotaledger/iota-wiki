# Transfer Tokens

The [Call Context](../../explanations/context.mdx) in smart contracts introduces two vital methods -
`balances()` and `allowance()` - to manage token balances efficiently.
Understanding how to use these can be foundational in setting up smart contracts,
as demonstrated in the `dividend` smart contract example.

## Methods Overview

### 1. **`balances()` Method**:

- **Functionality**: Fetch the present asset balances regulated by the smart contract.
- **Access**: Through the `ScBalances` proxy.

### 2. **`allowance()` Method**:

- **Functionality**: Verify the caller assets that the current smart contract function can use.
- **Transfer Requirement**: Assets are not automatically transferred;
  the function must instigate the transfer explicitly within the allowed limit.
- **Access**: Through the `ScBalances` proxy.

### 3. **`transfer_allowed()` Method**:

- **Functionality**: Facilitate asset transfers from the caller's on-chain account to another on-chain account.
- **Proxy**: uses the `ScTransfer` proxy, a mutable variant of `ScBalances`.
- **Application**: In the `dividend` contract, it aids in distributing iotas to member accounts.

## Dividend Smart Contract Example

The `dividend` smart contract operates on a principle of equitable asset distribution to its members based on predefined factors.
Here's how it works:

1. **Setup**: Establish a list of members with associated address/factor pairs and calculate the total factor sum.
2. **Function**: The `divide()` function manages the dividend distribution.
3. **Dividend Allocation**:
   - **Input**: Iotas sent to the `divide()` function.
   - **Distribution**: Proportional to the individual's factor.
   - **Example**: For factors A:50, B:30, and C:20 (total 100):
     - **A receives**: 50/100 of the input iotas.
     - **B receives**: 30/100 of the input iotas.
     - **C receives**: 20/100 of the input iotas.

In this system, asset distribution is transparent, fair, and automated, ensuring a streamlined division process.

Here is the `divide` function:
