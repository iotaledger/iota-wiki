# Use View-Only Functions

View-only functions, also known as "views",
are smart contract functions specialized in retrieving state information without altering the smart contract's state.

## Characteristics

### Immutable Proxies

All state storage accesses occur through immutable proxies, ensuring the state remains unchanged.

### Restricted Functionalities

Views have a limited [Call Context](../../explanations/context.mdx),
disabling any function that might induce state changes, including token transactions.

### Intra-chain Calls

While they can [`call()`](call.mdx) other views within the same chain,
they cannot initiate non-view functions or [`post()`](post.mdx) cross-chain requests.

### Return Data

These functions are designed to return data to the caller, as they can't induce any other external effects.

## Use Case: 'getFactor' Function

To illustrate the use of view-only functions, consider the `getFactor()` function integrated in the `dividend` smart contract:

<TabItem value="go" label="Go">

```go

// 'getFactor' is a simple View function. It will retrieve the factor
// associated with the (mandatory) address parameter it was provided with.
func viewGetFactor(_ wasmlib.ScViewContext, f *GetFactorContext) {
	// Since we are sure that the 'address' parameter actually exists we can
	// retrieve its actual value into an ScAddress value type.
	var address wasmtypes.ScAddress = f.Params.Address().Value()

	// Create an ScImmutableMap proxy to the 'members' map in the state storage.
	// Note that for views this is an *immutable* map as opposed to the *mutable*
	// map we can access from the *mutable* state that gets passed to funcs.
	var members MapAddressToImmutableUint64 = f.State.Members()

	// Retrieve the factor associated with the address parameter.
	var factor uint64 = members.GetUint64(address).Value()

	// Set the factor in the results map of the function context.
	// The contents of this results map is returned to the caller of the function.
	f.Results.Factor().SetValue(factor)
}
```

<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

```rust
// 'getFactor' is a simple View function. It will retrieve the factor
// associated with the (mandatory) address parameter it was provided with.
pub fn view_get_factor(_ctx: &ScViewContext, f: &GetFactorContext) {

    // Since we are sure that the 'address' parameter actually exists we can
    // retrieve its actual value into an ScAddress value type.
    let address: ScAddress = f.params.address().value();

    // Create an ScImmutableMap proxy to the 'members' map in the state storage.
    // Note that for views this is an *immutable* map as opposed to the *mutable*
    // map we can access from the *mutable* state that gets passed to funcs.
    let members: MapAddressToImmutableUint64 = f.state.members();

    // Retrieve the factor associated with the address parameter.
    let factor: u64 = members.get_uint64(&address).value();

    // Set the factor in the results map of the function context.
    // The contents of this results map is returned to the caller of the function.
    f.results.factor().set_value(factor);
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="Typescript">

```ts
// 'getFactor' is a simple View function. It will retrieve the factor
// associated with the (mandatory) address parameter it was provided with.
export function viewGetFactor(
  ctx: wasmlib.ScViewContext,
  f: sc.GetFactorContext,
): void {
  // Since we are sure that the 'address' parameter actually exists we can
  // retrieve its actual value into an ScAddress value type.
  let address: wasmlib.ScAddress = f.params.address().value();

  // Create an ScImmutableMap proxy to the 'members' map in the state storage.
  // Note that for views this is an *immutable* map as opposed to the *mutable*

  let members: sc.MapAddressToImmutableUint64 = f.state.members();

  // Retrieve the factor associated with the address parameter.
  let factor: u64 = members.getUint64(address).value();

  // Set the factor in the results map of the function context.
  // The contents of this results map is returned to the caller of the function.
  f.results.factor().setValue(factor);
}
```

The return values are passed to the caller through the predefined [Results](results.mdx) map
associated with the [Call Context](../../explanations/context.mdx).
Again, this works the same as for Funcs, although Funcs do not necessarily return values to the caller. The
[Schema Tool](usage.mdx) will generate a function-specific [Results](results.mdx)
structure with type-safe proxies to the result fields in this map.
