# Deploy a Smart Contract

You can deploy your smart contracts to [Shimmer EVM](https://explorer.evm.shimmer.network/) and
the [Shimmer EVM Testnet](https://explorer.evm.testnet.shimmer.network/) using popular tools like [Remix](#remix)
and [Hardhat](#hardhat).

:::tip Get a Basic Contract

This guide will deploy the `Counter` contract you can find in
the [How to Create a Basic Solidity Contract Guide](create-a-basic-contract.md).

Deploying a Solidity smart contract using Remix is a straightforward process that doesn't require any installation or
setup of development environments on your machine. Remix is a powerful, browser-based IDE that allows you to write,
compile, and deploy smart contracts.

### 1. Connect to Metamask

Before you get started, make sure you have connected Metamask to your network of choice.

:::tip Networks & Endpoints

You can check the connection details in the [Networks & Endpoints section](/build/networks-endpoints/).

<AddToMetaMaskButton cfg={EVMNetworks['shimmerevm']}/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Access Remix IDE

Open your web browser and navigate to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

### 3. Create Your Smart Contract

1. In the `File Explorer` tab on the left, click the `Create New File` icon.
2. Name your file `Counter.sol`.
3. Copy the Solidity code for the [basic counter smart contract](create-a-basic-contract.md) and paste it into
   the `Counter.sol` file you just created in Remix.

### 4. Compile Your Smart Contract

1. Navigate to the `Solidity Compiler` tab on the left sidebar.
2. Select the appropriate compiler version that matches the version specified in your contract (`^0.8.6` or similar).
   You might need to enable "Auto compile" or click the "Compile" button manually.
3. If there are errors, Remix will display them, and you'll need to correct them before proceeding.

### 5. Deploy Your Smart Contract

1. Switch to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab on the left sidebar.
2. In the "Environment" dropdown, select and select `Injected Web3` from the `Environment` dropdown.

   ![Select Injected Provider from the Environment dropdown](/img/evm/remix-injected-provider-metamask.png)
   
3. After selecting the environment, make sure the contract Counter is selected in the `Contract` dropdown.
4. Click the `Deploy` button. If you're using an Ethereum network, confirm the transaction in your Web3 wallet.

### 6. Interact with Your Deployed Contract

Once deployed, the contract instance will appear under the `Deployed Contracts` section.
Here, you can interact with your contract by calling its functions. For the Counter contract, you'll see buttons to call
its `increment`, `decrement`, and `getCount` functions directly from Remix.

The first thing you'll need to deploy a smart contract using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is to set up a Hardhat
project. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

### 1. Set Up Hardhat

1. Open a new terminal window.
2. Create a new directory for your project, and navigate into it. For example:
   ```bash
   mkdir deploy-a-basic-contract &&
   cd deploy-a-basic-contract
   ```
3. Create a new node project by running:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```
4. Install Hardhat by running:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev hardhat
   ```
5. Create a Hardhat Project by running the following command:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat
   ```

   Select "Create a basic sample project" when prompted and answer the setup questions (you can just press enter to
   accept defaults).

### 2. Add Your Contract

1. Inside the `contracts` folder, create a new file called  `Counter.sol` and paste the content of
   the [Counter Basic Contract](create-a-basic-contract.md).

### 3. Create a Deployment Script

1. Navigate to the `scripts` folder.
2. Create a new file called `deploy.js` with the following code:

   ```javascript
   async function main() {
       const Counter = await ethers.getContractFactory("Counter");
       const counter = await Counter.deploy();
   
       await counter.deployed();
   
       console.log("Counter deployed to:", counter.address);
   }
   
   main()
       .then(() => process.exit(0))
       .catch((error) => {
           console.error(error);
           process.exit(1);
       });
   ```

### 4. Compile and Deploy Your Contract

1. Add your preferred network parameters to the `hardhat.config.js`, for example:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value='testnet' label='ShimmerEVM Testnet'>

```javascript
networks: {
    'shimmerevm-testnet': {
        url: 'https://json-rpc.evm.testnet.shimmer.network',
        chainId:1073,
        accounts: ['YOUR PRIVATE KEY'],
    },
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='shimmerEVM' label='Shimmer EVM'>

```javascript
networks: {
    'shimmerevm': {
        url: 'https://json-rpc.evm.shimmer.network',
        chainId: 148, 
        accounts: [YOUR PRIVATE KEY],
    },
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::caution

Currently, there is no validation service available for EVM/Solidity smart contracts on IOTA Smart Contracts, which is
often offered through block explorer APIs.

:::

2. Compile your contract by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

3. If you have no compilation errors, you can deploy your contract by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network shimmerevm-testnet
   ```

   **Expected output**:

   ```bash
   Counter deployed to: 0x123456789ABCDEFGHIJK123456789ABCDEFGHIJK
   ```
   ***** `0x123456789ABCDEFGHIJK123456789ABCDEFGHIJK` is the contract unlock address.

4. You can verify your contract by visiting
   the [ShimmerEVM Testnet Explorer](https://explorer.evm.testnet.shimmer.network/),
   and searching for the address from the previous step. If you access the `Contract` tab, you should be able to see
   your code and interact with your contract.
