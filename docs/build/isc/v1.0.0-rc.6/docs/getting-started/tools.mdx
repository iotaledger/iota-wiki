# Compatible Tools

EVM on IOTA Smart Contracts has been integrated in a way that the existing EVM tooling is compatible and can be used
directly with an IOTA Smart Contracts chain running EVM as long as you take a couple of things into account.

## Tooling Considerations

1. Please make sure you use the correct JSON-RPC endpoint URL in your tooling for your chain. If you're running your own chain, you can find the JSON-RPC
endpoint URL in the Wasp dashboard (`[URL]/wasp/dashboard` when using `node-docker-setup`).
2. Please ensure you use the correct `Chain ID` configured while starting the JSON-RPC service. If you did not explicitly define this while starting the service, the default Chain ID will be <ChainId url='https://json-rpc.evm.shimmer.network'/>
for ShimmerEVM or <ChainId url='https://json-rpc.evm.testnet.shimmer.network' /> for the EVM Testnet.
3. Fees are handled on the IOTA Smart Contracts chain level, not the EVM level. The chain will reject any requests with a different gas price than specified by the chain.

:::caution

Re-using an existing Chain ID is not recommended and can be a security risk. For production usage, register a unique Chain
ID on [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/) and use that instead of the default. **It is not possible to change the EVM
chain ID after deployment.**

:::

## MetaMask

[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) is a popular EVM wallet which runs in a browser extension that allows you to
interact with EVM chains and their applications (dApps).

To use your EVM chain with MetaMask, simply open up MetaMask and click on the network drop-down list at the very top. At
the bottom of this list, you will see the option `Add network`. On the new page you will see a list of popular network with the option `Add a network manually`.
For example this would be the config to add the [ShimmerEVM](/build/networks-endpoints/#shimmerevm) and
the [ShimmerEVM Testnet](/build/networks-endpoints/#shimmerevm-testnet):

<Tabs>
<TabItem value='testnet' label='Public Testnet'>
<AddToMetaMaskButton cfg={EVMNetworks['shimmerevm-testnet']}/>

- Network Name: `Public Testnet`
- New RPC URL: `https://json-rpc.evm.testnet.shimmer.network/`
- Chain ID: **<ChainId url='https://json-rpc.evm.testnet.shimmer.network'/>**
- Currency Symbol: `SMR`
- Block Explorer URL: `https://explorer.evm.testnet.shimmer.network/`

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='shimmerEVM' label='ShimmerEVM'>
<AddToMetaMaskButton cfg={EVMNetworks['shimmerevm']}/>

- Network Name: `ShimmerEVM`
- New RPC URL: `https://json-rpc.evm.shimmer.network/`
- Chain ID: **<ChainId url='https://json-rpc.evm.shimmer.network'/>**
- Currency Symbol: `SMR`
- Block Explorer URL: `https://explorer.evm.shimmer.network/`

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Ensure that your `RPC Url` and `Chain ID` are set correctly and match the dashboard values. The `Network Name` can be
whatever you see fit. Click "Save" to add the [Public Testnet](/build/networks-endpoints/#public-testnet) to MetaMask.

If you wish to use additional EVM chains with Metamask, you can add more Custom RPC networks, as long as they have a
unique `Chain ID` and `RPC Url`. Once you have done this, you can start using MetaMask to manage your EVM wallet or
issue/sign transactions with any dApp running on that network.

### Remix

If you also want to use the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to deploy any regular Solidity Smart Contract, you
should set the environment as **Injected Provider - Metamask**, which should then connect with your MetaMask wallet.

Click on the _Deploy & Run transactions_ button in the menu on the left and select `Injected Web3` from
the `Environment` dropdown.

<DeployAdmonition/>

Metamask will ask to connect to Remix, and once connected, it will set the `Environment` to `Injected Web3` with
the "Custom (<ChainId url='https://json-rpc.evm.shimmer.network'/>) network" or "Custom (<ChainId url='https://json-rpc.evm.testnet.shimmer.network'/>) network".

![Environment will be set to Injected Web3](/img/evm/remix-injected-provider-set.png)]

## Hardhat

[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is a command line toolbox that allows you to deploy, test, verify, and interact with
Solidity smart contracts on an EVM chain. EVM chains running on IOTA Smart Contracts are compatible with Hardhat; simply
make sure you add the correct network parameters to your `hardhat.config.js`, for example:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value='testnet' label='Public Testnet'>

```javascript
networks: {
    'shimmerevm-testnet': {
        url: 'https://json-rpc.evm.testnet.shimmer.network',
        chainId: CHAIN_ID,
        accounts: [YOUR PRIVATE KEY],
    },
},
```
***** Where `CHAIN_ID`= <ChainId url='https://json-rpc.evm.testnet.shimmer.network'/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='shimmerEVM' label='ShimmerEVM'>

```javascript
networks: {
    'shimmerevm': {
        url: 'https://json-rpc.evm.shimmer.network',
        chainId: CHAIN_ID,
        accounts: [YOUR PRIVATE KEY],
    },
},
```
***** Where `CHAIN_ID`= <ChainId url='https://json-rpc.evm.shimmer.network'/>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<DeployAdmonition/>

:::caution

Currently, there is no validation service available for EVM/Solidity smart contracts on IOTA Smart Contracts, which is
often offered through block explorer APIs.

:::

## Ethers.js/Web3.js

If you input the correct configuration parameters for the JSON-RPC endpoint to talk
to, [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/) and [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) are also compatible with EVM
chains on IOTA Smart Contracts. Alternatively, you can let both interact through MetaMask instead so that it uses the
network configured in MetaMask. For more information on this, read their documentation.

## Other Tooling

Most tools available will be compatible if you enter the correct `Chain ID` and `RPC Url`.
