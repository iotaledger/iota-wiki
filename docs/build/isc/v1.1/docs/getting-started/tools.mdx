# Compatible Tools

EVM on IOTA Smart Contracts has been integrated in a way that the existing EVM tooling is compatible and can be used
directly with an IOTA Smart Contracts chain running EVM as long as you take a couple of things into account.

## Tooling Considerations

1. Please make sure you use the correct JSON-RPC endpoint URL in your tooling for your chain. If you're running your own chain, you can find the JSON-RPC
endpoint URL in the Wasp dashboard (`[URL]/wasp/dashboard` when using `node-docker-setup`).
2. Please ensure you use the correct `Chain ID` configured while starting the JSON-RPC service. If you did not explicitly define this while starting the service, the default Chain ID will be <ChainId url='https://json-rpc.evm.iotaledger.net'/>
for IOTA EVM, <ChainId url='https://json-rpc.evm.shimmer.network'/>
for ShimmerEVM or <ChainId url='https://json-rpc.evm.testnet.shimmer.network' /> for the EVM Testnet.
3. Fees are handled on the IOTA Smart Contracts chain level, not the EVM level. The chain will reject any requests with a different gas price than specified by the chain.

:::caution

Re-using an existing Chain ID is not recommended and can be a security risk. For production usage, register a unique Chain
ID on [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/) and use that instead of the default. **It is not possible to change the EVM
chain ID after deployment.**

## IOTA EVM Tools

The following tools are **only available on IOTA EVM**.

### Blast API

The [Blast API](/build/blastAPI) is a decentralized platform that provides reliable and scalable node infrastructure
for accessing blockchain data. You can find the Blast API URLs in the [Network RPCs](#network-rpcs)

### EVM Toolkit

You can use the [IOTA EVM Toolkit](https://evm-toolkit.evm.iotaledger.net) to withdraw assets from IOTA EVM to IOTA L1.
It also includes a wrapper IOTA <-> wIOTA.

### Multicall3

If you need to aggregate results from multiple contract reads into a single JSON-RPC request or execute multiple
state-changing calls in a single transaction, you can use the [Multicall3 contract](https://explorer.evm.iota.org/address/0xcA11bde05977b3631167028862bE2a173976CA11?tab=contract).

## IOTA EVM and ShimmerEVM Tools

The following tools are available on both IOTA EVM end ShimmerEVM.

### MultiSig Wallets

If you require and additional level of security, you can use the [Safe{} Wallet](https://safe.iotaledger.net/) as a
Multisig solution on IOTA EVM.

### Oracles

If your project requires [Oracles](/build/oracles/) to provide data from the outside world, you find both Pyth and Supra have integrated IOTA EVM.

<OraclesContractData />

### Subgraphs

[Subgraphs](/build/subgraphs/) provide a streamlined way for developers to access blockchain data relevant to their applications,
significantly enhancing developer efficiency and user experience. IOTA EVM subgraphs available via [Goldsky](https://goldsky.com).

## MetaMask

[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) is a popular EVM wallet which runs in a browser extension that allows you to
interact with EVM chains and their applications (dApps).

To use your EVM chain with MetaMask, simply open up MetaMask and click on the network drop-down list at the very top. At
the bottom of this list, you will see the option `Add network`. On the new page you will see a list of popular network with the option `Add a network manually`.
For example this would be the configs to add our different [EVM chains](/build/networks-endpoints):

<Tabs groupId='network' queryString>
<TabItem value='iota' label='IOTA EVM'>
<AddToMetaMaskButton {...Networks['iota']}/>
<NetworkInfo.Evm {...Networks['iota']}/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value='iota_testnet' label='IOTA EVM Testnet'>
<AddToMetaMaskButton {...Networks['iota_testnet']}/>
<NetworkInfo.Evm {...Networks['iota_testnet']}/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value='shimmer' label='ShimmerEVM'>
<AddToMetaMaskButton {...Networks['shimmer']}/>
<NetworkInfo.Evm {...Networks['shimmer']}/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value='shimmer_testnet' label='ShimmerEVM Testnet'>
<AddToMetaMaskButton {...Networks['shimmer_testnet']}/>
<NetworkInfo.Evm {...Networks['shimmer_testnet']}/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Ensure that your `RPC Url` and `Chain ID` are set correctly and match the dashboard values. The `Network Name` can be
whatever you see fit. Click "Save" to add the chain to MetaMask.

If you wish to use additional EVM chains with Metamask, you can add more Custom RPC networks, as long as they have a
unique `Chain ID` and `RPC Url`. Once you have done this, you can start using MetaMask to manage your EVM wallet or
issue/sign transactions with any dApp running on that network.

### Remix

If you also want to use the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to deploy any regular Solidity Smart Contract, you
should set the environment as **Injected Provider - Metamask**, which should then connect with your MetaMask wallet.

Click on the _Deploy & Run transactions_ button in the menu on the left and select `Injected Web3` from
the `Environment` dropdown.

![Select Injected Provider from the Environment dropdown](/img/evm/remix-injected-provider-metamask.png)

<DeployAdmonition/>

Metamask will ask to connect to Remix, and once connected, it will set the `Environment` to `Injected Web3` with
the "Custom (Chain ID) network".

![Environment will be set to Injected Web3](/img/evm/remix-injected-provider-set.png)]

## Hardhat

[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is a command line toolbox that allows you to deploy, test, verify, and interact with
Solidity smart contracts on an EVM chain. EVM chains running on IOTA Smart Contracts are compatible with Hardhat; simply
make sure you add the correct network parameters to your `hardhat.config.js`, for example:

<HardhatConfig/>

<DeployAdmonition/>

:::caution

Currently, there is no validation service available for EVM/Solidity smart contracts on IOTA Smart Contracts, which is
often offered through block explorer APIs.

:::

## Ethers.js/Web3.js

If you input the correct configuration parameters for the JSON-RPC endpoint to talk to,
[Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/) and [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) are also compatible with EVM chains on IOTA Smart Contracts.
Alternatively, you can let both interact through MetaMask instead so that it uses the
network configured in MetaMask. For more information on this, read their documentation.

## Other Tooling

Most tools available will be compatible if you enter the correct `Chain ID` and `RPC Url`.
