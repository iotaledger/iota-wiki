# Troubleshooting

You should use the troubleshooting section to answer FAQs, common problems and point the users to forums or websites
where they may find answers you could not provide within the documentation.

## Stack Exchange

The [IOTA Stack Exchange](https://iota.stackexchange.com/)
is an excellent tool for developers to find answers to their problems. Just search for your problem and find your
answer! If there is no answer yet, submit your question and share it in the discussion channel below.
