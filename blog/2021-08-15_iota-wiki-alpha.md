We proudly present the first alpha release of the IOTA  wiki. Built by the community for the community. The wiki is at an early stage, and we would really appreciate your contribution.
[Jeroen](https://github.com/jlvandenhout) has built a great in-page editor, which makes it easy to contribute to the wiki content without being a GitHub expert. You will however need a GitHub account. 

The wiki blog will also contain a collection of curated community posts in the future. The wiki will be a one-stop shop for IOTA information.. Let's BUIDL it together!
