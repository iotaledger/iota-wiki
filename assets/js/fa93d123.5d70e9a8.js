In nearly all blockchains, the block producers can decide which new transactions they prefer to include and confirm in the blocks they produce.

This parallel transactions form the "front" of the Tangle and offer many different points for new issued transactions to be attached, which dramatically speeds up the processing of transactions.\nEvery node in the network is free to attach new transactions to the network at any time.

Only this single block producer will earn all the fees of the transactions that are part of the issued block and earn the reward (in the form of newly created tokens) for producing the block. This is also seen as a form of centralization in blockchains, as you need middlemen that process your transactions. Regular users are not allowed to write directly to the ledger. That leads to the well-known "miner race," where only the miner with the highest computational processing power, or stakers with the highest stake, have a reasonable chance of becoming a block producer and are allowed to attach a new block including their processed transactions to the ledger. All the electricity used by the other miners in this race of solving the cryptographic puzzle needed to fulfill the proof of work requirements while producing the current block has been wasted, as their attempted blocks are never becoming part of the blockchain.
