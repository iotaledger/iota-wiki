Here we look at what that means for cryptocurrencies built on a proof of work model. When a given block has just been added to the blockchain, a race begins. In this race, to mine the next block the participants \u2013 most commonly referred to as miners \u2013 gather as many open transactions as they can into a new block body and calculate the Merkle root from that, and they calculate other information for their new block header as well, all except the four-byte nonce we mentioned above."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"The miner can set this nonce to any value they like, but the goal in doing so is to make the hash of the block header meet the target difficulty. To slightly oversimplify it, the nonce is changed and the header hashed repeatedly until the resulting hash begins with enough zeros. At the current difficulty, approximately one in every 75,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 possible headers will produce a hash with enough leading zeros to be valid.

These newly minted coins can be sold by the miner and are currently the primary way the miners are paid for their work.

This is where the user comes in."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"The role of users is simple. They buy, sell, and trade the currency native to their chosen blockchain.

The target difficulty of mining blocks is designed to force new blocks to be mined at a relatively constant rate.
