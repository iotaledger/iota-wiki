# Client Libraries

Client libraries handle communications between your software and the IOTA network. You can use a client library
to [connect to a node](/iota.rs/examples/get_info)
, [post a message](/iota.rs/examples/simple_message)
, [send a signed transaction](/iota.rs/examples/transaction), and many other operations.

## Iota.rs

The [iota.rs library](/iota.rs/welcome) is written
in [Rust](/iota.rs/getting_started/rust), and
has bindings for [Java](/iota.rs/getting_started/java/getting_started)
, [NodeJs](/iota.rs/getting_started/nodejs)
, [Python](/iota.rs/getting_started/python)
and [Wasm](/iota.rs/getting_started/wasm).

Both the IOTA Foundation and the IOTA community maintain the library and this
wiki, which means that you can rely on it as a source of knowledge on iota.rs.

## Iota.js

The [iota.js library](/iotajs/welcome) is implemented
in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), which gives it a strongly typed objects to send and receive from the
API and makes it convenient for both [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and browser environments.
