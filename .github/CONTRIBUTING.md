<summary>Report a bug :bug:</summary>
<br>

This section guides you through reporting a bug. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand the bug, reproduce the behavior, and find related bugs.

### Before reporting a bug

Please check the following list:

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [**Issues**](https://github.com/iota-community/iota-wiki/issues). If the bug has already been reported **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

**Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems similar to what you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### Submitting A Bug Report

To report a bug, [open a new issue](https://github.com/iota-community/iota-wiki/issues/new), and be sure to include as many details as possible, using the template.

**Note:** Minor changes such as fixing a typo can but do not need an open issue.

If you also want to fix the bug, submit a [pull request](#pull-requests) and reference the issue.

### Before adding a new feature/topic

Check if there is already an [open issue](https://github.com/iota-community/iota-wiki/issues/) or [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/iota-community/iota-wiki/pulls), related to your feature/topic.

Otherwise, your feature may not be approved at all.

### Adding a new feature/topic

<details>
<summary>Pull requests :mega:</summary>
<br>

This section guides you through submitting a pull request (PR). Following these guidelines helps give your PR the best chance of being approved and merged.

### Before submitting a pull request

Before submitting a pull request, please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

- A pull request should have exactly one concern (for example one feature or one bug). If a PR addresses more than one concern, it should be split into two or more PRs.

- A pull request can be merged only if it references an open issue

    **Note:** You don't need to open an issue for minor changes such as typos, but you can if you want.

- All code should be well tested

### Submitting a pull request

The following is a typical workflow for submitting a new pull request:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new branch based on your fork. For example, `git checkout -b fix/my-fix` or ` git checkout -b feat/my-feature`.
4. Commit changes and push them to your fork
5. Target your pull request to be merged with `develop`

If he maintainer approves the PR, it will be merged.

**Note:** Reviewers may ask you to complete additional work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be approved and merged.

# Contribute to the Iota-Wiki Content

This document describes how to contribute and add content to the IOTA wiki.

We encourage everyone with knowledge of IOTA technology to share this knowledge with the community and help so help new people to get a better understanding and help the onboarding of new users.

Thanks! :heart:



<br>

   
## Content strategy

The general menu structure of the WIKI website can be found in the readme file and is currently this:
   
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77154511/126027961-ea8b46fb-a777-44d8-bcd6-55692948a69b.png)



We want every contributor to understand the purpose of the Wiki and our way of delivering content. 

We want the Wiki to be the one single reference and source of truth and up-to-date information for everyone that needs information about the IOTA project. And the Wiki is meant as a gateway to provide everyone quick access to all information regarding IOTA.

We aim to deliver basic introduction content on the pages and whenever possible link the reader to more detailed content provided by the IOTA Foundation (Blog posts / Websites / Guides / Docs / Github). So you don't need to write an in-depth explanation about Mana for the Wiki if there is already very good up-to-date information available to where we can provide a link. So we would more give a general introduction to Mana in the Wiki and leave the detailed explanation in the Links.

But if you feel that the available information is insufficient, outdated, or too complex to understand for normal users we are happy about detailed understandable content about a topic. As IOTA has been moving fast forward this might the the situation for in many fields of the project atm.

We decided to split the WIKI into 4 major thematic areas that focus on the user/reader and the needs of those who visit the Wiki and we aim to deliver tailored content for that user group.

## Learn

The Learn section aims to describe most of IOTAs core functions and technology. Content should be explained in an understandable manner for normal random users that have no, or just a small knowledge about IOTA. We want to welcome interested people and show them the way into understanding IOTA and get fascinated about it. Perfect would be if we could provide also links to external sources that deliver further detailed content in different levels of complexity. Also welcome to link to an IF YouTube video.

As we know the protocol has changed a lot and quickly we might not find up-to-date information, so we will write it ourselves.

## Use

Content for people that may be looking to use IOTA in their project / Company / Industry. Showcase of all the possibilities the protocol delivers, the several technologies developed for use cases. Explain and provide useful links to lead the reader into the project.


## Participate

How can someone become active in the project? Where to interact with the community, how to engage with others or the technologies, and get a hands-on experience with IOTA.

Collect general info and link to Guides / POC's / Showcases / IF community sites. Create an interresting how to explanation... everything that catches users on the "oh yeah i wanna do this" - sense.

## Develop

The gateway for Developers. Introduces the core functionalities on a more technical level and aims to bring developers directly into the correct framework for them to start working with IOTA. Also, deliver guides and Tools that help getting started and to understand the concepts behind the protocol. This section will directly link to the underliying IOTA Docs and GitHubs, so please provide correct links to the specific content in the IOTA Docs.
   
## Adding content

To add content to a page you can use the implemented in-page-editor. This will make it easy to use and you can write content with the known tools simmilar as in a word or google doc. The editor translates this into a **`markdown`** file and creates an Pull Request to add this content into our GitHub Repository. We will check those Pull Requests and will approve it to be added, or will contact you if we have some suggestions to optimize the article or request changes.

Our aim is not perfections from everyone - it is a community driven project, but we may have to change some things as we aim for a simmilar language and style throughout the whole website. This should give the readers a feeeling that it is coming out of one source. So we will contact you on your Github account or comment directly in the Pull Request.

You can also create content directly in Github by forking the **`develop`** branch and start editing the pages you wish to contribute. The Page documents will be found under https://github.com/iota-community/iota-wiki/tree/develop/docs 
   
   

To edit a document, click the pencil (edit this file) in the top right corner when viewing in github.


   This will open up the Github editor so you can edit your file.


   All pages are themed and styled automatically and follow a standardised format throughout the wiki.


Each page’s content is preceded by its front matter information. This tells the wiki what it needs to know about the page to add it to the front-end in the right place. This does not need to be edited

```
---
id: my-doc-id
title: My document title
description: My document description
slug: /my-custom-url
---
```

   
```# Header 1``` – should only be used for page title/header using a single hash
   
```## Header 2``` – should be used for main sub-sections of the topic using a double hash
   
```### Header 3``` – should be used for internal sections of these sub-sections using treble hash


### Content

All page content should be written as standard text.

   
A paragraph can be created by leaving a double line break between two text blocks


### Formatting
   
Use single asterisk to make a word or sentence ```*italic*```

Use double asterisk to make a word or sentence ```**bold**```

Use triple asterisk to make a word or sentence ```***bold and italic***``` 

Use double tilde to ```~~strike through~~``` a word or sentence 

   
### Links
To add a link to a page we use square brackets to contain the link text followed by round brackets containing the link address:
```[this is a link](https://www.website.com)```

   
### Images
To add an image to a page we first need to upload the page to the [image folder]()
Then in our page we can add the image using the same method as a link preceded with an exclamation mark:
```![image text](https://image.link/here.jpg)```

   
### Image Links
To make an image a link, we can combine the two methods, by putting the link within the text section of the image code:
```[![Here is an example image](https://example.com/image.jpg)](https://example.com)```
   

### Lists
To create lists we use two different methods.

   ```
-	Bullet point
-	lists
-	using a hyphen
   ```

   ```
1.	Numbered
2.	Lists
3.	Using numbers
   ```

   
### Quotes
```
   >To add a quoted or embedded text, we use the greater than symbol at the start of the section. To close off a quote we create a new paragraph.
   ```

### Adding Code
There are two types of code entry we use ``` `inline code` ``` which is wrapped with single backticks
   
```
```Code blocks can be added in page where required
either to demonstrate function, 
or to add exclamation to a section,
by wrapping the section with treble backticks 
```
```

   
### Line Divider
   
We can add a line divider to break up the page by adding 4 dashes
```----
```
----
   

### Submitting your contribution
   
Once you have completed your contribution go to the bottom of the edit page to the commit changes section.

   
- In the title add the title of the page you have edited.
- Edited pagename.md
- In the description explain a little about your edits, whether it was fact correction, typo edits, or full page creation, page formatting, etc.
- Select create a new branch
- Name the branch after your name-pagename-edit
- Click commit changes
- This will open a pull request, where you can fill out the basic information for your updates.
- Then click the create pull request button
