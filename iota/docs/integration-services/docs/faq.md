# FAQ

## When should I use the Integration Services instead of IOTA Identity and IOTA Steams?

The Integration Services **abstracts** technical complexity of the Identity and Streams frameworks. Furthermore, the usage is **independent of any technology** stack because the Integration Services can be accessed via REST APIs. All data is **cached** and can be accessed without long waiting times. Additionally, the Integration Services provide more functionality by allowing users to **search for channels** or validate channel data. Channels, channel subscriptions, and verifiable credential can **easily be maintained**.

## Is there a public API where I can test my code?

You can test your implementation on our public API which is connected to the IOTA Mainnet.
