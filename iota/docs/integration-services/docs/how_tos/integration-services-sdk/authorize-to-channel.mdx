# Authorize a Channel

The example-6 script performs the following tasks:

1. Create two identities: `Owner` and `User`.
2. Authorize each identity against Integration Services API using different clients.
3. `Owner` creates a channel and writes data on it.
4. `User` tries to read from said channel, but fails because `User` does not have access.
5. `User` requests to [subscribe to the channel](#subscribe-to-channel).
6. `Owner` finds an unapproved subscription, and [authorizes it](#authorize-subscription).
7. `User` [sends data to the channel](#write-to-a-channel).
8. `Owner` is able to [read the second message sent by `User` from that channel](#read-from-a-channel).


You can run the example with the following command:

<Tabs groupId={"programmingLanguage"}>
<TabItem value="Java" label={'Java'}>

```bash
mvn exec:_java -Dexec.mainClass=net.gradbase.how_tos.AuthorizeToChannel
```

**Example source code**: [Example-6](https://github.com/albydeca/iota-is-sdk/blob/main/examples/src/main/java/net/gradbase/examples/AuthorizeToChannel.java)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Nodejs" label={'Node.js'}>

```bash
npm run example-6
````

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Subscribe to a Channel

In this example, the `userClient` tries to read from a channel while it did not have read/write permissions. This will raise an exception. The correct way is to first request subscription as shown in the following script:

<Tabs groupId={"programmingLanguage"}>
<TabItem value="Java" label={'Java'}>

```java
JSONObject subRequest = userClient.requestSubscription(channelAddress,
new JSONObject().put("accessRights", AccessRights.READ_AND_WRITE.toString()));
String subscriptionLink = subRequest.getString("subscriptionLink");
System.out.println("subscription link " + subscriptionLink);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Nodejs" label={'Node.js'}>

```js
// Request subscription to the channel as the user. The returned subscriptionLink can be used to authorize the user to the channel.
const { subscriptionLink } = await userClient.requestSubscription(channelAddress, {
accessRights: AccessRights.ReadAndWrite
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Authorize a Subscription

In order to allow `userClient` to read and write on that channel, its subscription needs to be authorized as shown in the following script:


<Tabs groupId={"programmingLanguage"}>
<TabItem value="Java" label={'Java'}>

```java
// Find subscriptions to the channel that are not already authorized.
List<SubscriptionInternal> allSubs = ownerClient.findAllSubscriptions(channelAddress, false);

for (SubscriptionInternal sub : allSubs) {
    if (!(sub.isAuthorized())) {
    System.out.println("authorising subscription " + sub.getId());
    JSONObject auth = ownerClient.authorizeSubscription(channelAddress,
    new JSONObject().put("id", channelUser.getJSONObject("doc").getString("id")));
    System.out.println("KeyloadLink: " + auth.getString("keyloadLink"));
}
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Nodejs" label={'Node.js'}>

```js
// Find subscriptions to the channel that are not already authorized.
const subscriptions = await ownerClient.findAllSubscriptions(channelAddress, false);

const unauthorizedSubscriptions = subscriptions.filter(subscription => !subscription.isAuthorized)

for (const subscription of unauthorizedSubscriptions) {
    // Authorize the user to the channel.
    // Authorization can happen via the id of the user or the generated subscription link.
    const keyloadLink = await ownerClient.authorizeSubscription(channelAddress, {
    id: channelUser.doc.id
    });
    console.log("Subscription Keyload Link:", keyloadLink)
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Write to a Channel

`userClient` can now write on a channel any JSON payload as using the following script:

<Tabs groupId={"programmingLanguage"}>
<TabItem value="Java" label={'Java'}>

```java
ownerClient.write(channelAddress, "log", null, new JSONObject().put("log", "This is log number 1"));
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Nodejs" label={'Node.js'}>

```js
// Writing data to the channel as the channel owner.
await ownerClient.write(channelAddress, {
    payload: { log: `This is log file 1` }
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Read from a Channel

`userClient` can now read from the channel successfully using the following script:

<Tabs groupId={"programmingLanguage"}>
<TabItem value="Java" label={'Java'}>

```java
    List<ChannelData> data2 = userClient.read(channelAddress, null, null, null, null, null);
    for (ChannelData d : data2) {
        System.out.println(d.toString());
    }
```

</TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Nodejs" label={'Node.js'}>

```js
    // Writing data to the channel as the channel owner.
    await ownerClient.write(channelAddress, {
    payload: { log: `This is log file 1` }
    });
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
