# IOTA Identity

IOTA Identity provides a digital identity anchored on the Tangle and verifiable credentials (VC) 
that are attachable to said identity. For example, a university student could use this to [validate his degree](https://wiki.iota.org/identity.rs/tutorials/validate_university_degree), or it could be applied in combination with [IOTA Streams](streams.md) to validate a patient's prescriptions and medical data as illustrated bellow.
