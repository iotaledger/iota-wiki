# Abstract

In IOTA, nodes use the milestones issued by the Coordinator to reach a consensus on which transactions are confirmed. This TIP proposes a milestone payload for the blocks described in the IOTA protocol [TIP-24](../TIP-0024/tip-0024.md). It uses Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) to authenticate the milestones.

# Motivation

In order to integrate the concept of milestones consistently into Tangle blocks, this TIP describes a dedicated payload type for milestones. In this context, the document also describes how Ed25519 signatures are used to assure authenticity of the issued milestones. In order to make the management and security of the used private keys easier, simple multisignature features with support for key rotation have been added.

# Specification

The [BLAKE2b-256](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7693) hash of the _Milestone Essence_, consisting of the actual milestone information (like its index number or position in the tangle), is signed using the Ed25519 signature scheme as described in the IRTF [RFC 8032](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032).

To increase the security of the design, a milestone can (optionally) be independently signed by multiple keys at once. These keys should be operated by detached signature provider services running on independent infrastructure elements. This assists in mitigating the risk of an attacker having access to all the key material necessary for forging milestones. While the Coordinator takes responsibility for forming Milestone Payload Blocks, it delegates signing in to these providers through an ad-hoc RPC connector. Mutual authentication should be enforced between the Coordinator and the signature providers: a [client-authenticated TLS handshake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#Client-authenticated_TLS_handshake) scheme is advisable. To increase the flexibility of the mechanism, nodes can be configured to require a quorum of valid signatures to consider a milestone as genuine.

In addition, a key rotation policy can also be enforced by limiting key validity to certain milestone intervals. Accordingly, nodes need to know which public keys are applicable for which milestone index. This can be provided by configuring a list of entries consisting of the following fields:
- _Index Range_ providing the interval of milestone indices for which this entry is valid. The interval must not overlap with any other entry.
- _Applicable Public Keys_ defining the set of valid public keys.
- _Signature Threshold_ specifying the minimum number of valid signatures. Must be at least one and not greater than the number of _Applicable Public Keys_.

## Milestone ID

The _Milestone ID_ is the BLAKE2b-256 hash of the serialized _Milestone Essence_.
It is important to note that the signatures do not impact the _Milestone ID_.

## Structure

### Serialized Layout

All values are serialized in little-endian encoding. The serialized form of the milestone is deterministic, meaning the same logical milestone always results in the same serialized byte sequence.

The following table describes the entirety of a _Milestone Payload_ in its serialized form following the notation from [TIP-21](../TIP-0021/tip-0021.md):

### Milestone options

The `Options` field holds additional data authenticated by the milestone.

The following table lists all the `Milestone Option Type` that are currently supported as well as links to the corresponding specification:

| Payload Name        | Type Value | TIP                                                         |
|---------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Receipt             | 0          | [TIP-34](../TIP-0034/tip-0034.md#receipt-milestone-option)  |
| Protocol Parameters | 1          | [TIP-29](#protocol-parameters-milestone-option)             |

#### Protocol Parameters Milestone Option

This `Milestone Option` is used to signal to nodes the commencing of new protocol parameters, including new protocol
version or PoW difficulty.

</table>

##### Syntactic Validation
 - `Target Milestone Index` must be greater than `Index Number` of the milestone it is contained in.
 - `Target Milestone Index` must be less than or equal to `Index Number` + 30. (This value is fixed and technically not a protocol parameter as defined in [TIP-22](../TIP-0022/tip-0022.md), as it should not be subject to protocol parameter changes induced by this option.)
 - `length(Parameters)` must not exceed `Max Metadata Length`.

## Milestone Validation

Similar to transaction validation, milestone validation has been separated into two classes. For a milestone to be valid, both of them need to be true.

### Syntactic validation

Syntactic validation can be checked from the _Milestone Essence_ plus the blocks in the past cone referenced by it.

- Essence:
  - `Index Number` must not be smaller than `First Milestone Index`.
  - If `Index Number` equals `First Milestone Index`, the following fields must be zeroed out:
    - `Previous Milestone ID`
    - `Inclusion Merkle Root`
    - `Applied Merkle Root`
  - If `Index Number` is greater than `First Milestone Index`, the milestone must reference (i.e. one of the `Parents` must contain or reference) another syntactically valid milestone whose _Milestone ID_ matches `Previous Milestone ID`. With respect to that referenced milestone, the following must hold:
    - `Index Number` must increment by `1`. 
    - `Timestamp` must be strictly larger (i.e. at least one second later).
    - `Inlcusion Merkle Root` must match the Merkle tree hash of the IDs of all blocks in _White Flag Ordering_ (as described in [TIP-2](../TIP-0002/tip-0002.md#deterministically-ordering-the-tangle)) that are newly referenced. (This always includes at least one valid milestone block with `Previous Milestone ID`.)
    - `Applied Merkle Root` must match the Merkle tree hash of the not-ignored state-mutating transactions that are newly referenced (see [TIP-2](../TIP-0002/tip-0002.md)).
  - `Parents` must match the `Parents` field of the encapsulating _Block_, i.e. the _Block_ that contains the _Milestone Payload_.
  - `length(Metadata)` must not exceed `Max Metadata Length`.
  - Options:
    - `Milestone Option Type` must match one of the values described under [Milestone Options](#milestone-options).
    - The option itself must pass syntactic validation.
    - The options must be sorted in ascending order based on their `Milestone Option Type`. 
- Signatures:
  - `Signatures Count` must be at least the _Signature Threshold_ and at most the number of _Applicable Public Keys_ for the current milestone index.
  - For each signature block the following must be true:
    - `Signature Type` value must denote an `Ed25519 Signature`.
    - `Public Key` must be contained in _Applicable Public Keys_ for the current milestone index.
    - `Signature` must contain a valid signature for `Public Key`.
  - The signature blocks must be sorted with respect to their `Public Key` in lexicographical order.
  - Each `Public Key` must be unique.
- Given the type and length information, the _Milestone Payload_ must consume the entire byte array of the `Payload` field of the _Block_.
    
### Semantic validation

Semantic validation is defined in the context of all available blocks.

- The milestone chain must not fork, i.e. there must not be two different, syntactically valid milestones with the same `Index Number`. In case of a fork, the correct state of the ledger cannot be derived from the milestones alone and usually the node implementation should alert the user and halt.

# Rationale

- Due to the layered design of blocks and payloads, it is practically not possible to prevent reattachments of _Milestone Payloads_. Hence, this payload has been designed in a way to be independent from the block it is contained in. A milestone should be considered as a virtual marker (referencing `Parents`) rather than an actual block in the Tangle. This concept is compatible with reattachments and supports a cleaner separation of the block layers.
- Forcing matching `Parents` in the _Milestone Payload_ and its block makes it impossible to reattach the same payload at different positions in the Tangle. Strictly speaking, this violates the separation of payload and block. However, it simplifies milestone processing as the position of the block will be the same as the position encoded in the Milestone Payload. Having these clear structural properties seems to be more desirable than a strict separation of layers.
- While it is always possible to cryptographically prove that a block was confirmed by a given milestone by supplying all the blocks of a path from the milestone to the block, such a proof can become rather large (depending on the blocks). To simplify such proof-of-inclusions, the `Inclusion Merkle Root` of all the included blocks has been added.
