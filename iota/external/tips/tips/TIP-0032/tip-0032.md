# Summary

This TIP describes the global protocol parameters for the Shimmer protocol.

# Motivation

Various other protocol TIPs rely on certain constants that need to be defined for an actual implementation of nodes or other applications using the protocol. This TIP serves as a single document to provide these parameters. It also serves as a historical record of protocol parameter changes.

# Detailed design

## Shimmer Units

The base token of the Shimmer Network is Shimmer (`SMR`). `SMR` token representation supports 6 decimal places, therefore the smallest possible value that may occur in the network is  10<sup>-6</sup> `SMR` = 0.000001 `SMR`. This indivisible amount is called a `glow`.

The concept of `glow` is analogous to [`satoshi` for `BTC`](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit)), or [`wei` for `ETH`](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/WEI).

| Amount in `glow`       | Amount in `SMR` |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| 1 glow                 | 0.000001 SMR    |
| 10 glow                | 0.00001 SMR     |
| 100 glow               | 0.0001 SMR      |
| 1,000 glow             | 0.001 SMR       |
| 10,000 glow            | 0.01 SMR        |
| 100,000 glow           | 0.1 SMR         |
| 1,000,000 glow         | 1 SMR           |
| 10,000,000 glow        | 10 SMR          |
| 100,000,000 glow       | 100 SMR         |
| 1,000,000,000 glow     | 1,000 SMR       |
| 10,000,000,000 glow    | 10,000 SMR      |
| 100,000,000,000 glow   | 100,000 SMR     |
| 1,000,000,000,000 glow | 1,000,000 SMR   |

**On protocol level, all token amounts are recorded in `glow`. [Outputs](../TIP-0018/tip-0018.md#output-design)
of a [transaction](../TIP-0020/tip-0020.md#structure) specify the
transfer amounts in `glow`. Graphical user interfaces of explorers, wallets and other tools are recommended to display
transfer amounts in `SMR` denomination.**

## Genesis Supply

The Shimmer genesis supply is allocated according to the following figure:

![](genesis-supply.png)

### IOTA Stakers - 80%

80% of the Shimmer genesis token supply has been distributed to IOTA token holders who staked their tokens to receive SMR during
the Shimmer staking event:
 - Start date: Tuesday, December 28, 2021 3:00 PM CET ([Milestone #2102114](https://explorer.iota.org/mainnet/search/2102114))
 - End date: Monday, March 28, 2022 8:12 PM CET ([Milestone #2879714](https://explorer.iota.org/mainnet/search/2879714))
 - [Community-validated](https://github.com/iotaledger/participation-events/pull/2) results: https://github.com/iotaledger/participation-events/blob/master/results/staking/shimmer.json

[Rewards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iotaledger/participation-events/master/results/staking/shimmer.json) are recorded in the base unit of the Shimmer network, `glow`. 1 `SMR` token equals 1,000,000 `glow`.

In total, **1,450,896,407,249,092 `glow` (~1,450,896,407 `SMR`) is allocated to IOTA Stakers** in the Shimmer genesis snapshot.

### Shimmer Community Treasury (DAO) - 10%

The IOTA community carried out an [on-chain vote](https://github.com/iotaledger/participation-events/blob/master/events/vote/shimmer_funding.json) on the initial [Shimmer Ecosystem Funding Proposal](https://govern.iota.org/t/discussion-proposal-to-increase-the-shimmer-supply-for-a-community-treasury/1291) and its [follow-up proposal](https://govern.iota.org/t/discussion-follow-up-proposal-to-the-establishment-of-a-shimmer-ecosystem-fund/1315).

The [community-validated result](https://github.com/iotaledger/participation-events/pull/10/files) of the vote allocated 10% of the new total Shimmer supply to a Shimmer Community Treasury DAO.

As a consequence, the **genesis Shimmer snapshot allocates 181,362,050,906,137 `glow` (~181,362,051 `SMR`) to the address of the Shimmer Community Treasury**:
 - **smr1qrmakyqt5ezm5k9c0sk39gwfavpktxkjmx0jvh9ejxjq6pr6d39egv2mvuc**

### Tangle Ecosystem Association (TEA) - 10%

The Tangle Ecosystem Association was set up by the IOTA Foundation to host the new structure of the Ecosystem Development Fund and other ecosystem-focused activities.

The [community-validated result](https://github.com/iotaledger/participation-events/pull/10/files) of the same [on-chain vote](https://github.com/iotaledger/participation-events/blob/master/events/vote/shimmer_funding.json) on the initial [Shimmer Ecosystem Funding Proposal](https://govern.iota.org/t/discussion-proposal-to-increase-the-shimmer-supply-for-a-community-treasury/1291) and its [follow-up proposal](https://govern.iota.org/t/discussion-follow-up-proposal-to-the-establishment-of-a-shimmer-ecosystem-fund/1315) allocates 10% of the total Shimmer genesis supply to the Tangle Ecosystem Association.

As a consequence, the **genesis Shimmer snapshot allocates 181,362,050,906,136 `glow` (~181,362,051 `SMR`) to the address of the Tangle Ecosystem Association**:

# Rationale for parameter choices

## Proof-of-work

Initially, `Min PoW Score` was chosen to roughly match the difficulty of a data transaction in the legacy IOTA protocol:
- The payload length (`signatureMessageFragment`) of a legacy transaction is 2187 trytes or 1100 - 1300 bytes depending on the encoding.
- With a minimum weight magnitude (trailing zero trits) of 14, this corresponds to a PoW score of about 4000.

The Stardust protocol debuts on Shimmer and as such, it is the first network capable of supporting L2 smart contract chains (ISC).
One possible bottleneck of smart contract chain performance is the time it takes to compute PoW for smart contract chain anchor
transactions, as these are typically bigger than the aforementioned legacy IOTA transaction size.

Accordingly, Shimmer lowers `Min PoW Score` to 1500 to ease the operation of smart contract chains and facilitate the
development of the L2 smart contract ecosystem. This value was chosen based on calculations with block sizes for smallest possible blocks (46 byte -> minimum weight magnitude of 11) and typical ISC on-chain requests for chain deployment and chain deposits (~573 byte -> minimum weight magnitude of 13).

## Transaction and block limits

The blocks parameters `Max Block Length` and `Max Parent Count`, as well as the transaction parameters `Max Inputs Count`, `Max Outputs Count`, `Max Native Token Count`, `Max Tag Length` and `Max Metadata Length` govern the block and transaction validity. Their values have been chosen to ensure functionality of the protocol within constrained resource restrictions. Furthermore, choosing more conservatives values here is preferable as increasing such limits can always been done preserving backward compatibility.

## Dust protection

The `VByte Cost` is the core parameter of the dust protection. The reasoning behind its value is explained in [TIP-19 Dust Protection](../TIP-0019/tip-0019.md).
