# Summary

This TIP describes the global protocol parameters for the IOTA protocol.

# Motivation

Various other protocol TIPs rely on certain constants that need to be defined for an actual implementations of nodes or other applications using the protocol. This TIP serves as a single document to provide these parameters. It also serves as a historical record of protocol parameter changes.

# Detailed design

# Rationale for parameter choices

## Proof-of-work

The `Min PoW Score` has been chosen to roughly match the difficulty of a data transaction in the legacy IOTA protocol:
- The payload length (`signatureMessageFragment`) of a legacy transaction is 2187 trytes or 1100 - 1300 bytes depending on the encoding.
- With a minimum weight magnitude (trailing zero trits) of 14, this corresponds to a PoW score of about 4000.

## Transaction and block limits

The block parameter `Max Block Length` and `Max Parent Count`, as well as the transaction parameters `Max Inputs Count`, `Max Outputs Count`, `Max Native Token Count`, `Max Tag Length` and `Max Metadata Length` govern the block and transaction validity. Their values have been chosen to ensure functionality of the protocol within constrained resource restrictions. Furthermore, choosing more conservatives values here is preferable as increasing such limits can always been done preserving backward compatibility.

## Dust protection

The `VByte Cost` is the core parameter of the dust protection. The reasoning behind its value is explained in [TIP-19 Dust Protection](../TIP-0019/tip-0019.md).
