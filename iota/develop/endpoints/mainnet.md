# Mainnet

## Public Infrastructure

The IOTA Foundation currently provides the following public load-balanced mainnet endpoints:

- https://chrysalis-nodes.iota.org.
- https://chrysalis-nodes.iota.cafe.

These endpoints have MQTT (via WebSockets) exposed and offer the HTTP REST API (according to this [specification](nodes/rest-api/iota-rest-api.info.mdx))
over TLS.
